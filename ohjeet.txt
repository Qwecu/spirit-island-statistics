/home/lasse/.bashrc not updated, /home/lasse/pgsql is already mentioned there, so assuming this is reinstall and it is up to date.

mkdir: cannot create directory ‘/home/lasse/pgsql/sock’: File exists
Creating database, please wait.
initdb: error: directory "/home/lasse/pgsql/data" exists but is not empty
If you want to create a new database system, either remove or empty
the directory "/home/lasse/pgsql/data" or run initdb
with an argument other than "/home/lasse/pgsql/data".
createdb: error: database creation failed: ERROR:  database "lasse" already exists

******
You may need to start new terminal (or relogin) for environment variables
to update.

Use command start-pg.sh to start database, ctrl-c to stop it.

If you are running this with computer which is in private use (ie. not a lab
computer), you could also start and stop database in the background using
pg_ctl utility, refer to documentation for details.

When it is running, you can connect to database in different terminal with
command:
    psql

When you need to connect to database from code, use socket in
/home/lasse/pgsql/sock
with default database name and no need to give username or password. Please
do not hardcode this into your code, this connection will only work for you.
